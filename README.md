## Why Mauve Taupe?
I created Mauve Taupe because I was tired of seeing the same traditional dark themes in the marketplace. While there are some pink themes available, many are either too highly saturated or lack accessibility considerations. Mauve Taupe strikes the perfect balance between aesthetics and functionality, offering a calming yet vibrant color scheme that works for everyone.

# Features
Soothing Color Palette: A blend of muted mauve and taupe tones that are easy on the eyes.

Syntax Highlighting: Clear and distinct syntax highlighting for better code readability.

Customizable: Works well with most popular extensions and languages.

Variants (Coming Soon!)
I’m currently working on additional variants to make Mauve Taupe even more versatile:

High Contrast: For improved visibility in low-light conditions.

Light Mode: A brighter alternative for those who prefer light themes.

High Contrast Light Mode: A high-contrast version of the light theme for maximum accessibility.
